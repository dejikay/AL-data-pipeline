## ‚öôÔ∏è Instructions

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ndleah/AL-data-pipeline.git
cd AL-data-pipeline
```

Run the Docker container with docker compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

The container will start in detached mode and can now be accessed via [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501). 

Whenever you change the app/streamlit_app.py the steamlit application will update too. If you want to build upon that example, just add your dependencies to the Dockerfile and rebuild the image using docker-compose.

After you are done, and you want to tear down the application, either

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

to stop the application, or use 

```bash
docker-compose down --rmi all
```

to stop the application, remove the stopped containers and optionally `--rmi all` / remove all images associated in the docker-compose.yml file.
